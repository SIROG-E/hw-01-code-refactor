## Description

The goal was to:
- Be able to find semantic elements when the source code is viewed.
- Find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning when the structure of the HTML elements are viewed.
- Find accessible alt attributes when the image elements are viewed. 
- Have heading attributes fall in sequential order when viewed.
- To find a descriptive and concise tittle when tittle element is viewed.
